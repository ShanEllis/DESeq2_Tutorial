## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

It is the R equivalent of a Jupyter Notebook. (I'm biased, but I think they're way spiffier than Jupyter Notebooks. And, don't get me wrong. I think Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool!)

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Note that R has a handful of datasets built in. `cars` is one of them. `pressure` (used below) is another one of them

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. How you want the code chunk (~code cell) to behave is specified within the {}. There are two general approaches to plotting in R: `base R`. That's what was used above and `ggplot2` (that's what I'll introduce below). 

## R Basics

### Assignment 

There are two assignment operators: `<-`/`->` and `=`. R users prefer `<-`, as it allows for directionality.

```{r}
# three eqiuivalent lines
my_val <- 0
my_val2 = 0
0 -> my_val3

print(c(my_val, my_val2, my_val3))
```

### Loops & Conditionals

All the base functionality in Python exists in R (like loops, conditionals, functions, etc.); however, the syntax is different. Python *definitely* wins when it comes to cleanness of syntax here. Lots of {} curly braces involved in for loops and condtionals in R.

```{r loops-conditionals}
val <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
out <- c()

for(x in val){
    if(x < 3){ 
        out <- c(out, x)
    }
}
        
out
```

### Functions 

Function definition happens according to the following general syntax:

```{r functions}
function_name <- function(input_val){
    output = c()
    
    for(val in input_val){
        output = c(output, val + 1)
    }
    
    output
}

function_name(input_val = c(1, 2, 3))

```


Note that an explicit return statement is not needed. Whatever the last variable is is returned from the function.

### Working with data

There is something called the tidyverse. Think of it as a suite of packages that make working with tabular data really easy in R and use a consistent API across (meaning all the packages "play nicely" together. A few of these packages are:

- `readr`: for reading in various tabular data types (CSV, txt, etc.)
- `dplyr`: for manipulating data frames (think: removing rows, renaming rows, filtering, etc.; `pandas`' counterpart)
- `ggplot2`: for making visualizations

#### `readr`

The general syntax for reading in a CSV file is `df <- read_csv('path/to/file/file.csv')`. Functions from the `readr` package will start with the prefix `read_`.

#### `dplyr`

`dplyr` has a *ton* of functionality. We'll use the `diamonds` dataset to demonstrate some of this functionality:

```{r diamonds}
diamonds
```

**`filter`**

Within the tidyverse, the general approach to analysis and data manipulation uses piping. The pipe `%>%` can be read as "and then". So the code below says take the `diamonds` dataset *and then* filter it based on the specified conditions.

```{r filter}
diamonds %>% 
    filter(color == 'E', depth < 60)
```

**`select`**

We can also specify which columns we're interested in. We can build onto the previous statement by adding an additional pipe.

```{r select}
diamonds %>% 
    filter(color == 'E', depth < 60) %>% 
    select(carat, cut, color, depth)
```

**`arrange`**

It's also quite easy to sort, using `arrange`. If we wanted to sort our rows by carat, we could do the following (again, building on what we've already done above):

```{r arrange}
diamonds %>% 
    filter(color == 'E', depth < 60) %>% 
    select(carat, cut, color, depth) %>%
    arrange(carat)
```

There's a ton more within the `dplyr` package to explore! But, for brevity, I'll stop there.

#### `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` applies the grammar of graphics to plots in R. Once you understand that grammar, you can easily build any type of plot.

The general syntax is:

```
ggplot(df, aes(x=val, y=val)) +
    geom_*()
```

This allows you to specify what data to use, what specific columns to use, and what geometry to apply.

To see an example, let's generate a boxplot of carat by cut:

```{r boxplot}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = carat)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
```

Because `ggplot2` is built on this idea of layering, we can use the above and then add layers to this plot to customize it:


```{r custom-boxplot}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = carat)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = "Diamonds of a 'Fair' cut tend to be of a higher carat",
         x = "Diamond Cut",
         y = "Carat") + 
    theme_classic()
```

In the above plot I changed the axis labels, added a title, and applid a theme to remove the background. 

Note that the `tidyverse` is a tool. It is great for working with tabular data. But, it is not great when working with other object types (i.e. the `DESeq` objects)
